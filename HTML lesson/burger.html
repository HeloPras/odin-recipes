      Burger is used to describe a popular sandwich made from ground meats that
      are formed into a patty, cooked, and placed between two halves of a bun.
      Although the most common Burger is made with meat, there are many
      alternatives that do not include meat, such as tofu or ground vegetables.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 1/2 pounds ground chuck (80 percent lean) or ground turkey (90 percent
        lean)
      </li>
      <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
      <li>4 slices cheese (optional)</li>
      <li>4 hamburger buns, split; toasted, if desired</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol style="width: 30%;">
      <li>
        Divide the meat into 4 equal portions (about 6 ounces each). Form each
        portion loosely into a 3/4-inch-thick burger and make a deep depression
        in the center with your thumb. Season both sides of each burger with
        salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        IF USING A GRILL: Heat a gas grill to high or heat coals in a charcoal
        grill until they glow bright orange and ash over. Brush the burgers with
        the oil. Grill the burgers until golden brown and slightly charred on
        the first side, about 3 minutes for beef and 5 minutes for turkey. Flip
        over the burgers. Cook beef burgers until golden brown and slightly
        charred on the second side, 4 minutes for medium rare (3 minutes if
        topping with cheese; see step 3) or until cooked to desired degree of
        doneness. Cook turkey burgers until cooked throughout, about 5 minutes
        on the second side.
      </li>
      <li>
        IF USING A GRILL PAN: Heat a grill pan over high heat on top of the
        stove. Cook the burgers as for a grill, above.
      </li>
      <li>
        IF USING A SAUTE PAN OR GRIDDLE (PREFERABLY CAST IRON): Heat the oil in
        the pan or griddle over high heat until the oil begins to shimmer. Cook
        the burgers until golden brown and slightly charred on the first side,
        about 3 minutes for beef and 5 minutes for turkey. Flip over the
        burgers. Cook beef burgers until golden brown and slightly charred on
        the second side, 4 minutes for medium rare (3 minutes if topping with
        cheese) or until cooked to desired degree of doneness. Cook turkey
        burgers until cooked throughout, about 5 minutes on the second side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cheese, if using, to the tops of the burgers during the last
        minute of cooking and top with a basting cover, close the grill cover,
        or tent the burgers with aluminum foil to melt the cheese.
      </li>
      <li>Sandwich the hot burgers between the buns and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
