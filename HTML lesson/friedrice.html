      <li>
        Heat a large skillet or wok over high heat, then add the 2 tablespoons
        of oil and the bacon. Cook the bacon, stirring occasionally, until
        crispy, about 2 minutes. Stir in the onion, garlic, carrots and snap
        peas and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables start to
        soften, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the eggs to the skillet, then add the rice directly into the wet
        egg. Using the back of a spatula or spoon, press the rice into the egg,
        fold and repeat until the rice is completely coated and heated through.
        Add the soy sauce and oyster sauce and stir to coat the rice. Season
        with a pinch of salt. Cook over high heat, stirring, until the rice is
        heated through, 2 to 4 minutes. Garnish with the scallions and some
        white pepper.
